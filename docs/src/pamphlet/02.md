Structure
---------

**wookie** is structure in services, and clients.  Services are representations of
Services in AWS.  Clients are HTTP clients that evaluates `Request`s and
transform them into responses in the target monad.

### Services

* Each service is a different artifact
* each one of them provide the following packages:
  * `ast` which contains the Algebraic Data Type of the service. this algebraic
  data type contains all operations that can be done to the given service.
  * `interpreter` an interpreter of the ADT.
  * `ServiceName` object.  Wires up all parts of the service into one small
  object that provides a `run` method.  This method transforms a `SercviceOp[A]`
  into the target `Monad`.
  * `language` where the typeclass of the service is defined and implemented.
  * `implicits` contains all the implicits related to the underlying `aws-java`
  project.  All our services calls need a `Marshaller[Request[A], A]`, where `A`
  is our request type, and a response handler.

### HTTP Clients

There are several HTTP clients already provided in **wookie**:

* [akka-http](https://akka.io)

However, it is really simple to implement a new http client, you just need to
implement the following interface:

```scala
trait HttpClient {
  def exec[A, B](request: Request[A])(implicit H: HttpResponseHandler[AmazonWebServiceResponse[B]]): Future[B]
}
```
