wookie
------

**wookie** is a library for using [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/es/)
services from Scala.


### Add wookie to your project

```
"io.pepegar.gihub" %% "wookie-core" % "0.1-SNAPSHOT"
```

Each one of the AWS Services are in its own isolated project, and they follow
the following naming structure:

```
"io.pepegar.gihub" %% "wookie-{service}" % "0.1-SNAPSHOT"
```

So, for example, if you want to use DynamoDB,

```
"io.pepegar.gihub" %% "wookie-dynamodb" % "0.1-SNAPSHOT"
```

### Currently implemented services

Currently we have implementation for:

* DynamoDB
* S3
