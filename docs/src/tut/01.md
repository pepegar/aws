Rationale
---------

### Purely functional AWS library
Wookie is based in free monads and interpreters.  With this approach we can have
all the operations we want to have in an abstract syntax tree that will be
evaluated by our interpreter upon our request.

### Modular
Wookie lets you use the HTTP client of your choice. There are interpreters for
the following clients:

- [akka-http][akka-http]

But you can implement your own! You just need to implement a function like
follows:

```tut:silent
def interpret[A](op: DynamoDBOp[A]): Future[A]
```

[akka-http]: https://akka.io
